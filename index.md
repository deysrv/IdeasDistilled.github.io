Hi buddy, welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Sourav Dey. Right now, Iâ€™m diving into Mathematically Driven Geometric Processing, Optimization Algorithms, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and of course, LLMs (how could I miss the hype? ðŸ˜Š Just kidding!).

Iâ€™m not an expert in any of these fields - thatâ€™s exactly why this blog exists. Itâ€™s a space where I share my thoughts, insights, and learnings as I explore these fascinating topics. Expect a mix of intuition, technical deep dives, and occasional ramblings.

Hope you find something interesting here.
